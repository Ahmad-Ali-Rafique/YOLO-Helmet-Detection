# YOLO-Helmet-Detection
This project implements a helmet detection system using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) and Streamlit. The application allows users to upload an image and detect helmets in real-time. The system uses OpenCV and pre-trained YOLOv3 weights to identify helmets in uploaded images, displaying the results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
